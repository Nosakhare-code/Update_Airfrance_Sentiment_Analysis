# ✈️ Customer Sentiment & Revenue Risk Dashboard

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates how customer feedback can be transformed into **financially actionable insights** using sentiment analysis and business modeling.

The dashboard identifies dissatisfaction trends, measures emotional intensity, and estimates potential revenue loss due to customer churn.

## Business Problem
Customer complaints are abundant but rarely quantified financially.  
Management teams need a way to **prioritize issues based on economic impact**, not just volume.

## Solution
- Analyze customer comments using **NLP**
- Measure **sentiment** and **emotional intensity**
- Categorize complaints into **operational themes**
- Apply **churn** and **lifetime value assumptions**
- Estimate **future revenue at risk**

## Sample Results
- 56 customer comments analyzed  
- 64% dissatisfied customers  
- High emotional intensity  
- Estimated **€36,000 revenue at risk**

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **NLP** (BERT sentiment scoring)  
- **Streamlit**  
- **Plotly**  
- **Financial modeling assumptions**
